        <li>Activist Marijana Mutavcieva said their activities started over a years ago, that they first turned to the state institutions for help, then went out into the streets and ended up in the woods. She said she was addressing the people from outside instead of from inside “the home of all citizens of the Republic of Serbia” to tell them what the people assembled around the Sordos Survivor Camp are demanding from the Mayor of Novi Sad and other state institutions.</li>
        <li>Environmental activists have been protesting against the construction of a bridge across the Danube in the northern Serbian city of Novi Sad. The construction site is surrounded by woods which environmental activists have warned will be cut down. Mutavcevic read out the activists’ demands that include a request for the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) to show its permits for the beginning of construction work on the bridge across the Danube and the project design.</li>
        <li>The Novi Sad Mayor was also asked to make public the agreement signed with the CRBC, while the inspectorate is requested to inspect the construction site and establish if the construction work that began on Tuesday is legal, as there was no information board on site. Among others, further demands also include an investigation into whether the cutting of trees at the Sordos site on June 11 was a case of deforestation, to identify and punish those responsible for this, while the public company Urbanizam is asked to present an environmental impact assessment.</li>
        <li>Sordos Survivor Camp activists, who have been trying for days to prevent the cutting of trees and construction works at the Sordos site in Novi Sad, invited citizens to a protest entitled Novi Sad Liberation Day scheduled for October 23, reported portal 021.</li>

        <li>The Regional Cooperation Council (RCC) said on Friday that Western Balkan Foreign Ministers reached three regional agreements during the Berlin Process summit in Berlin. The RCC said that agreement was reached to allow travel across the region with ID cards only as well as on recognizing university diplomas and allowing doctors, dentists and architects to work freely anywhere in the region.</li>
        <li>“Two years of hard work finally payed off. Three regional agreements have been approved at Berlin Process Summit Ministries of Foreign Affairs meeting in Berlin,” the RCC said on its Facebook profile. It said that this means “Tearing down the last remaining visa wall in the region, travel only with ID. Students not having to pay up to 500€ to have their diplomas recognised in the region, recognition of higher education qualifications. Doctors, dentists and architects can work with no barrier in the Western Balkans”.</li>
        <li>“We proudly showcase that all-inclusive regional cooperation and Common Regional Market deliver results. The region has agreed on three RCC-coordinated centrepiece mobility agreements whose implementation, much like with the green lanes and regional roaming agreement, will very soon bring their own manifested impact on the ground,” RCC Secretary General Majlinda Bregu is quoted as telling Friday’s meeting.</li>
        <li>KFOR is a story of success and this success is a result of all those who politically and on the ground contributed to stability, safety and freedom of movement for the benefit of all communities living in Kosovo and supporting the development of a constructive dialogue between the parties, said Commander Ristuccia.</li>
